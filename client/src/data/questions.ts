      "Document all current findings in a summary report, clear context completely, then use that report as the sole reference for continuing the investigation.",

Production monitoring reveals three consistency issues: (1) compound phrases like \"Python and SQL\" are sometimes kept as one entry, sometimes split; (2) implied but unstated skills occasionally appear in extractions; (3) similar documents produce wildly different array lengths (5-10 vs 40+ entries). Your prompt currently says \"Extract all skills mentioned.\"\nWhat's the most effective improvement?",
